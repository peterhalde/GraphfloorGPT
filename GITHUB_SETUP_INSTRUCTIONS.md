# GraphfloorGPT GitHub Repository Setup

## The Git configuration is locked in Replit. Here's how to set up your repository manually:

### Option 1: Download and Upload
1. Download the project archive: `graphfloorgpt-complete.tar.gz`
2. Extract it locally on your computer
3. Create new repository on GitHub: https://github.com/new
   - Repository name: `GraphfloorGen` (to match what you created)
   - Description: `AI-powered knowledge graph platform transforming PDFs into intelligent graphs`
   - Public repository
   - Don't initialize with README
4. Upload all extracted files to the new repository

### Option 2: Clone from Replit
1. In your local terminal:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/peterhalde/GraphfloorGen.git
cd GraphfloorGen
```

2. Copy files from this Replit project to your local clone
3. Commit and push:
```bash
git add .
git commit -m "Initial commit: Complete GraphfloorGPT implementation"
git push origin main
```

## Current Project Status
- ✅ Complete deduplication system with semantic matching
- ✅ Claude Sonnet 4 integration for AI entity extraction  
- ✅ Interactive knowledge graph visualization
- ✅ Database schema and API endpoints
- ❌ **Critical bug**: Identical "Teig" nodes not detected as duplicates

## Repository URL
Once set up: https://github.com/peterhalde/GraphfloorGen

## Next Steps
1. Set up the repository using one of the methods above
2. Share the working repository URL with me
3. I can then clone it and create proper pull requests for bug fixes
4. Continue development with proper version control

The Replit Git environment has restrictions, but all your code is committed locally and ready for transfer.
